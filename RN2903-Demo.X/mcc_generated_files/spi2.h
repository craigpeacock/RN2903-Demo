  @Summary
    Initializes the SPI2

  @Description
    This routine initializes the SPI2.
    This routine must be called before any other MSSP2 routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

  @Preconditions
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Comment
    

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t     myWriteBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     myReadBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     writeData;
    uint8_t     readData;

  @Summary
    Exchanges a data byte over SPI2

  @Description
    This routine exchanges a data byte over SPI2 bus.
    This is a blocking routine.

  @Preconditions
    The SPI2_Initialize() routine should be called
    prior to use this routine.

  @Param
    data - data byte to be transmitted over SPI2 bus

  @Returns
    The received byte over SPI2 bus

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t     writeData;
    uint8_t     readData;
    uint8_t     readDummy;

    SPI2_Initialize();

  @Summary
    Exchanges buffer of data over SPI2

  @Description
    This routine exchanges buffer of data (of size one byte) over SPI2 bus.
    This is a blocking routine.

  @Preconditions
    The SPI2_Initialize() routine should be called
    prior to use this routine.

  @Param
    dataIn  - Buffer of data to be transmitted over SPI2.
    bufLen  - Number of bytes to be exchanged.
    dataOut - Buffer of data to be received over SPI2.

  @Returns
    Number of bytes exchanged over SPI2.

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t     myWriteBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     myReadBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t     total;
